# Connect-Four

The game Connect Four, written in Java. Playable with two players or against the computer (with a negligible chance of winning).

This program came out of an assignment for an Object Oriented Programming course. Please note that it was written without the use of abstract classes, interfaces, enums, and Collections as these concepts had not yet been introduced at the time of the assignment.
